To make a text file in jupyter we do this 
f = open('practice.txt','w+')
f.write('This is a test String')
f.close() 

To get the pwd working directory we can just pwd however you cant use that in other py scripts. In order to get the pwd we can use 

Import os 

Os.getcwd() and that will allow us to get the working directory 

os.listdir()  will give you a list of all files in your location. 

os.listdir("C:\\Users")  you can also add arguments 


import shutil 

shutil.move('practice.txt','C:\\Users\\Skylar\\Desktop\\udemy\\practice.txt')

import send2trash

shutil.move('C:\\Users\\Skylar\\Desktop\\udemy\\practice.txt',os.getcwd())

send2trash.send2trash('practice.txt')

files = 'C:\\Users\\Skylar\\Desktop\\udemy\\Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp-master\\13-Advanced Python Modules\\practice.txt'
for folders, sub_folders, files in os.walk(files):
    print(f"Currently looking at {folder}")
    
    for sub_fold in sub_folders:
        print(sub_fold)
    
    for f in files:
        print(f)


you can import datetime 

date1 = date(2020,11,3)
date2 = date(2021,11,3)

result = date1 - date2 

result.days
